Shooting arrows was never so much fun. \r\n\r\nWar Heroes Clash Battle Boom is simple and easy to play, this game is a combination of strategy, magic and some funny jokes. It requires you plan how to barricade your defenses (don’t just build and upgrade everything you can in a random order) and plan your attacks carefully (just sending every soldier you have won’t cut it) in order to win every battle and make your commander - THE COMMANDER.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ ARCHER WARRIOR VS. ARMIES OF THRACKUS ★★★★★\r\n\r\nThe saga of this god of war is well known in greek history. Some say he is son of Zeus. Another legend is that he was sent on earth by Hades, while another tale has it that he is Apollo himself in disguise. With his Hercules strength he stands like a tower between the mighty force of the demon Thrackus and wall of justice. Equipped with god's armor and blessed with super attack speed, he awaits his share of action. He is leader of clan and the mightiest soldier ever seen.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ WEAPONS AND MAGIC ★★★★★\r\n\r\nVariety potions and spells make killing of evil easier and even more fun.

When facing a large crush of armies, to counter them, its lethal strategy to unleash heroes in the middle of battle. They are your friends and alliance in thickest of war. They dont fight with bomb and bullet, but prefer sword and hammer. Use them wisely because they can be hired only on a time basis as mercenaries.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ STRIKE AND DEFEND ★★★★★\r\n\r\nAttack is the best form of defence. In combat never loose touch of pressurizing your opponent. Shooting like a sniper is good but some times random fire is a good way to fend of enemies.

The memories still burn deeply, like spicy chicken wings.\r\n\r\n\"They came without warning, squawking menacingly, their ruffled feathers darkening the sun. Invading intergalactic chickens, out to punish humanity for our oppression of their earthly brethren.\r\n\r\n\"I instantly knew what had to be done. I dropped my half-eaten chicken burger and jumped in my cockpit. With a greasy finger I set my lasers to \"extra crispy\" and blasted off to intercept the fowl invaders.\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't easy. Squawks, feathers flying, the smell of charred chicken everywhere. Three times they invaded, each time with increasingly devious plans. Three times I managed to push them back whence they came, and secure humanity a few more years as the dominant species of this planet.\r\n\r\n\"After their last retreat, I headed for my local Space Burger to bask in the glow of my recent victory. Breathing a sigh of relief, I sat down to enjoy a double chicken-burger with crispy chicken wings on the side.\r\n\r\n\"Little did I know that my greatest adventure was yet to come...\"\r\n\r\n\"Ultimate Omelette\" is the title of the fourth episode in the Chicken Invaders series of casual space shooter games. The game puts players at the forefront of a battle against invading intergalactic chickens, bent on revenge against the human race for our oppression of Earth chickens. In this episode, the chickens have constructed a gigantic cannon capable of launching planet-scale eggs against Earth, with the ultimate goal of encrusting humanity in an impenetrable wall made of egg white. Joined by an unlikely ally, players will travel to foreign, unexplored galaxies in an effort to locate and destroy the egg cannon before it reaches Earth.\r\n\r\nThe enemy repertoire has been significantly broadened, introducing several different kinds of chickens which attack relentlessly in colorful groups and meticulously choreographed formations. The chicken fray is punctuated by fights against boss enemies spanning up to three times the size of the screen. The arsenal at the player's disposal has also been correspondingly extended, with three new weapons and four kinds of supporting satellites providing additional firepower. The player's intergalactic journey is also accentuated by unique fantastic scenarios, such as navigating through a field of gigantic floating feathers, or dodging molten planet chunks during a supernova explosion.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJ9WM","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Microsoft Bingo","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10830.9007199266251894.2addb906-a153-4170-aaa4-d2af9f899d47.23edd399-67e0-40cd-83c8-f7334fd1a502","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#318FB7","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7679.9007199266251894.1f501570-a57b-4beb-9fe5-ae3adbdfdc27.b8ab3ec8-0e29-4e29-aa9d-aa6149e55c00","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#318FB7","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20090.9007199266251894.ceeed96f-b7f4-40e7-bf62-4da4b5eae17a.8b500323-8353-45f5-ad66-dabd227edf1a","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#318FB7","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30745.9007199266251894.d41c68f8-a162-4716-bb58-dbf323128fe8.57778567-903d-4fcc-8200-4989cbdffa19","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#318FB7","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1052.9007199266251894.e0981686-8f96-442b-a55d-01d78de0f5ba.2a2feab7-7160-41f1-9e4e-0312bf280ba2","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#318FB7","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.65535.9007199266251894.6ef30594-bfd6-40f3-81e3-05e1fb161a68.e03233eb-8358-4456-bca4-b97cf1cf8860","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#318FB7","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15067.9007199266251894.1ecbc979-577e-413e-8045-4f20c5145402.21ce5c2f-7ed9-43cf-8688-cf56585e58db","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#318FB7","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35496.9007199266251894.9b912cfe-3484-4ce6-8588-70a8c8816787.0b226f36-91ac-4121-aeef-ed07865541ac","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42966.9007199266251894.08970b3e-a161-4dfb-a8d5-56569104db2e.1152d4dd-3d56-4ff3-8361-1d8bac621188","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58161.9007199266251894.c0a93fa1-87da-4395-8a7f-1005f78e6338.8f9f8e90-15df-4fe9-91a5-159a9b80469f","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#318FB7","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.5,"RatingsCount":"4","PackageFamilyNames":["Microsoft.MicrosoftBingo_8wekyb3d8bbwe"],"ContentIds":["112ed009-05f6-72ae-08d5-7841c77aeb8a","1775d1da-125f-6de5-bd3c-ed5e8f975996","40fac71a-5314-e309-ea87-85a11787639a"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"BINGO! \r\n\r\nDust off your daubers.
