All you have to do is point your device at the sky.\r\n\r\n“She’s a beauty.”\r\nThe Next Web\r\n\r\n“Star Walk 2 is a terrific introduction to astronomy for young and old. It’s also handy for serious stargazers for observing planning.” \r\nTUAW\r\n\r\n“For those who enjoy the original app, Star Walk 2 is worth the upgrade — the interface is gorgeous. Anyone with even a passing interest in astronomy should grab Star Walk 2.” \r\niLounge\r\n\r\n“It is worth every penny.” \r\nPadGadget\r\n\r\nDISCOVER NEW DEPTHS\r\nStar Walk 2 is the first astronomy guide to introduce plausible three-dimensional models of planetary nebulae. Star groupings of the 88 officially recognized constellations are also presented in volume. You can see them as separate entities, turn them around and take a look from the other side. Complemented by articles on connected myths and history, this is the most comprehensive collection of information on constellations.*\r\n\r\nREAL-TIME MOTION TRACKING\r\nAs you hold your phone up and point it towards the sky, Star Walk 2 follows your motions using the built-in gyroscope to match the map on your screen to the stars seen from your location. Easily find any star, constellation, or satellite in the sky by tapping Search. Star Walk will indicate the direction to look in. \r\n\r\nNEW POINT OF VIEW\r\nUnlike on a plain photograph, every star in Star Walk 2 has coordinates. That means you can look at objects, for instance, a constellation from any vantage point in space, not to mention the ultimate accuracy of your map for your exact location. \r\n\r\nNOW AND LATER \r\nStar Walk 2 gives you accurate daily data on current moon phase, time of sunset and sunrise, and elevation of planets. With just one slide you can see how the sky will look later tonight or throughout the year. \r\n\r\nPRO STARGAZING\r\nSpecial night-time soft red mode will help you preserve night vision when stargazing with a telescope. You can see the sky in X-Ray (and 5 more filters) to study the invisible structure of the universe. Live tracking for over 8,000 satellites will help you catch iridium flares, and detailed articles will satisfy the most curious inquirer.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH5QH8J","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"3D Mahjong.","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34913.13510798887157147.c50b8f91-42a6-407a-a5f6-bdbba210ad90.f62484e0-10d2-46c4-9d55-e91521b82af2","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#ff0000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.65327.13510798887157147.65b3981a-3ab2-425e-9d18-14c7fe248a68.05e2275f-d9e0-4789-af66-bb1ee0b10a73","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#ff0000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$1.99","Price":1.99,"AverageRating":4.2,"RatingsCount":"17","PackageFamilyNames":["44630ChaoZeng.39431542CE301_66trf94yww210"],"ContentIds":["a0b16999-d63d-d06f-bb90-b4646ad975fc"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Mahjong 3D adds a new and exiting twist to the classic Mahjong puzzle games. \r\n\r\nIn this game, the Mahjong board is not layered flat on a table.

Beautiful flowers make them feel the joys of spring, and the painting process turns into an enthralling game where they can bring their fantasies to life and draw a red daffodil, or a blue sunflower.\n\nPaint by numbers - an interactive coloring book for children. This mathematical game teaches children to recognize numbers and solve simple mathematical examples. In addition, this program develops memory, attention, imagination, and logical abilities.\nBoys and girls of all ages love to color. The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors.

Just point on a code and the result will show immediately at the bottom together with the most recent functions in the app bar. The menus on the left and right side can be opened easily with a tap on the button in the app header, or just swiped in from the edge. Onehanded use is simply a breeze. \r\n\r\nBesides the scanning using the camera, QR Scanner+ also offers the possibility to read codes located on images. If needed, QR Scanner+ can save scanned codes in the ‘Catalog’ for later use.\r\n\r\nQR Scanner+ does support following content types:\r\n- URL\r\n- Windows Store URL\r\n- contact information / business cards (vCard, meCard, bizCard)\r\n- calendar event / appointments (vEvent)\r\n- geo-location\r\n- eMail address\r\n- eMail message\r\n- phone number\r\n- SMS\r\n- WiFi (connect with a single tap)\r\n- text\r\n- SEPA Credit Transfer (Giro Code)\r\n- barcodes\r\n\r\nWhen searching products by scanning a barcode, QR Scanner+ can deliver results that are most useful.

You can choose Bing, Baidu, DuckDuckGo, Google, Yandex or a custom URL to e.g Amazon, Ebay, Pricegrabber, Idealo... With this approach QR Scanner+ can deliver the information you are searching for.\r\n\r\nYou should just try QR Scanner+ and convince yourself.

A small dash of logic and you'll be able to solve any puzzle and there will be no limit to your exploratory spirit while interacting with the game's world: fire coconuts from a mammoth's trunk, turn into an animal or save the fair maiden from the Octo-Boss' grasp.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NHM9137SSP3","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Injustice™ 2 - Legendary Edition","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4910.13627352252285326.9e9a61f6-fdbe-497e-a06f-c80c8acb3ada.e6920519-d18b-470a-bbc5-6c0aa6699e0d","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"#FFFFFF","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4855.13627352252285326.9e9a61f6-fdbe-497e-a06f-c80c8acb3ada.d30d93bb-ee3e-43bd-8fdd-9ea0dfde2783","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"#FFFFFF","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29081.13627352252285326.9e9a61f6-fdbe-497e-a06f-c80c8acb3ada.faba4f6c-1f49-4887-95d2-c1fcf51dce34","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"#FFFFFF","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$59.99⁺","Price":59.99,"AverageRating":2.8,"RatingsCount":"12","PackageFamilyNames":[""],"ContentIds":[],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Power up and build the ultimate version of your favorite DC legends in INJUSTICE 2 – winner of IGN's best fighting game of 2017.\r\n•ALL DOWNLOADABLE CONTENT CHARACTERS: Includes 10 additional characters and 5 Premiere Skins – including Hellboy and TMNT.\r\n•EVERY BATTLE DEFINES YOU: With every match you'll earn gear to equip, customize and evolve your roster.\r\n•A NEW THREAT RISES: Picking up where Injustice left off, Batman struggles against Superman's regime, as a new threat appears that will put Earth's very existence at risk.\r\n•THE BEST OF DC: Choose from the biggest DC Universe roster ever and battle across iconic locations in epic scale battles.\r\n•BUILT BY NETHERREALM: Developers of the best-selling and critically acclaimed MORTAL KOMBAT franchise.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NMN6XNFC5N8","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Docs for Microsoft Office - MS Word, PowerPoint, Excel Document Templates","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27553.13689124062596363.5b726785-5a20-43d7-894c-819c68e5a7ac.2c81c27b-df34-45be-b1fa-7a1329f12947","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12033.13689124062596363.49403652-0ce7-48fb-836c-a899a8af639f.29a5c28c-39c9-446f-8476-a0f327216bb9","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"StrikethroughPrice":"$39.99","DisplayPrice":"$14.99","Price":14.99,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["15799Dinebulla.DocumentsforMicrosoftOffice-MSWordP_hb0h1tr5399ja"],"ContentIds":["db73fcd9-5456-8208-9234-a3c1db5572c9","51b87b83-6bf5-6016-e778-b9e7f41dc5db"],"Badges":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V3.ProductBadge, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","StyleKey":"Default","Text":"SAVE $25.00","Type":"Merchandized"}],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Suite for Microsoft Office is the collection of premium quality design templates for Microsoft Word, PowerPoint and Excel.

Moon, the natural satellite of the planet Earth, is a rocky spherical body without atmosphere and life that orbits our planet.\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that only one side of the moon is visible from the Earth, we have the opportunity to see a little more than half of its surface from the Earth. With the help of modern technology, we can see all the sides of moon from the space.\r\n\r\nNow, even the details of the far side of the moon are known with a resolution ten times better than the details of its visible side back in 1960. All the high detailed images of the moon were put together to create a complete, realistic model in this 3D screensaver and Live Wallpaper.\r\n\r\nIn an animated Moon wallpaper you will be able to distinguish the little craters, maria, and highlands on its surface as if you look at the Moon from its orbit. This app also allows you to zoom the moon in and out, rotate it and set the desire rotation speed with a click of a mouse. The wallpaper renewal frequency can also be adjusted.\r\n\r\nThis app can be used as a 3D screensaver when launched in full screen or you can enable Live Wallpaper mode and launch it in a small window to have new wallpaper generated for you regularly.\r\n\r\nThe default mode is a Live Wallpaper, so if you want a screensaver it will not launch on its own. You can change this app setting by clicking in the right bottom corner of the app window.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PC78LK9DBNN","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"PNG Converter -

There are plenty of puzzles thrown in that combine realistic physics and logical reasoning with switches, levers and pushable blocks required to open doors and trapdoors, and to reach otherwise inaccessible places.\r\n\r\nOn A Roll 3D is an immensely fun and very challenging retro platform game!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PDTN43FLJM4","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Fernz Gate","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6626.14147572471866937.21897a36-f1f6-4621-a0ad-a577f6d33eb8.1de3d642-7ccb-49a7-bfb0-0673ae4b5e48","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29110.14147572471866937.21897a36-f1f6-4621-a0ad-a577f6d33eb8.99a68154-c92c-4e8c-93e9-b2d458eb722f","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15795.14147572471866937.21897a36-f1f6-4621-a0ad-a577f6d33eb8.7c0814d0-8cb0-465c-a22e-4320a35718af","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29419.14147572471866937.21897a36-f1f6-4621-a0ad-a577f6d33eb8.d0d74390-0a6f-4fe2-827c-8b2f2c643078","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42938.14147572471866937.21897a36-f1f6-4621-a0ad-a577f6d33eb8.0005ccb7-ba44-4607-bb0a-2afcdc26bb2f","Height":2160,"Width":2160,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62453.14147572471866937.21897a36-f1f6-4621-a0ad-a577f6d33eb8.452c0540-2482-4d5e-b15e-fd3cbffbe7c0","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"StrikethroughPrice":"$14.99","DisplayPrice":"$10.49⁺","Price":10.49,"AverageRating":3.0,"RatingsCount":"4","PackageFamilyNames":["KEMCO.FernzGate_f2bp5vqmgh7cp"],"ContentIds":["be9c7345-7985-b958-8557-fe377f14bf54","500f2ac7-9cbf-0117-83c1-912e7dcbdbe8"],"Badges":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V3.ProductBadge, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","StyleKey":"Default","Text":"SAVE $4.50","Type":"Merchandized"}],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Travel to the other side and beyond and find a way back home in a fantasy RPG!\r\n\r\nAfter awaking in unfamiliar woods, Alex, an ordinary high schooler living an ordinary life, learns he has somehow ended up in Fernland, a world dominated by conflict and destruction.\r\nFighting monsters, the ever-ominous threat of the Overlord, and a succession of chaotic events as he tries to find his own place in this new world, Alex comes across Lita, a young woman from a peaceful world like his own.\r\nHitting it off, they soon become friends and set out together, but what hidden truth awaits them as their adventure begins to unfold...?\r\n\r\nJoin forces with buddies and fight!

The notes for each voice are hold in a track and you can assign an arbitrary sound to each track to give it its specific character. So you can arrange the song in a creative way and create and publish your own interpretations.\r\nMany of the midi files are free (for example: Mutopia Project with tousends of songs), others are copyright protected and have to be purchased.\r\nThe SoundDesigner Music Creator contains a collection of 4 synthesizer engines: GM Bank, Additive Synthesizer, Waveform Modulator and Sampler.

The two partnerships are North/South and East/West. \r\n\r\nIn Rubber Bridge a rubber is played as the best of three games. A game is won by the first partnership to score 100 or more points in successful contracts.\r\n\r\nIn Chicago Bridge you play four hands of Bridge. The winner is the partnership that scores the most points in those hands.\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NCD50N5S813","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Galax Defender","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60550.13570336553636278.c2ab0845-3a1d-46ec-9cfd-05389a421d57.b93e29c8-8d54-4dec-a0df-0d258b3ccf9a","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62124.13570336553636278.c2ab0845-3a1d-46ec-9cfd-05389a421d57.a131ab04-bcf3-4694-aad8-061ef48a1ecf","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5082.13570336553636278.c2ab0845-3a1d-46ec-9cfd-05389a421d57.ff8497ab-26cf-4436-8426-f353100ab21f","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20564.13570336553636278.c2ab0845-3a1d-46ec-9cfd-05389a421d57.dec514c3-8a8d-4bdc-8cc5-e1adc33d861b","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38940.13570336553636278.c2ab0845-3a1d-46ec-9cfd-05389a421d57.7446586e-2571-4a80-9763-e26077c1ac08","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19433.13570336553636278.c2ab0845-3a1d-46ec-9cfd-05389a421d57.f0a12966-6c6d-4ea0-a535-3ba61ee7411a","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51748.13570336553636278.c2ab0845-3a1d-46ec-9cfd-05389a421d57.5e445007-8995-4b94-aef4-56f2115dcad8","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51056.13570336553636278.c2ab0845-3a1d-46ec-9cfd-05389a421d57.af815cd2-52bc-4ebd-8b9e-4a271892cab8","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44551.13570336553636278.c2ab0845-3a1d-46ec-9cfd-05389a421d57.696cf1a0-b608-434b-ab08-9fad818a11c0","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$1.99","Price":1.99,"AverageRating":2.6,"RatingsCount":"5","PackageFamilyNames":["23227LuisMedel.Galax_w178tqa71wegr"],"ContentIds":["f9467d16-5aee-f412-152a-9676757a5aae","9f054e6c-a4b4-76be-a07d-41b1c27a8a2e"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Control your fighter, with its unique ability to combine with other fighters, and shoot down the invading aliens.\r\n\r\nAliens attack in formations using a variety of attack patterns.

The surface of the planet Jupiter is peculiar and exotic. If you look at it from the Earth during the period of opposition with a naked eye, then a pale-yellow star will be visible in the starry sky, which is second only to Venus and Mars.\r\n\r\nIf you take a closer look at Jupiter from space or even a telescope, dark reddish stripes can be distinguished (they are called belts), which alternate with lighter (zones). Today, people can explore this gas giant more than ever. After traveling five years and decades or planning, NASA’s Juno spacecraft finally reached Jupiter’s orbit.\r\n\r\nThe spacecraft allowed to see Jupiter from its orbit in high details. Now, you can set Live Wallpapers - animated desktop backgrounds or turn on a 3D screensaver mode and explore this planet up close on your own by zooming in and out as well as rotating the planet. The settings also allow one to adjust how often a new Jupiter wallpaper is generated. \r\n\r\nThis app can be used as a 3D screensaver when launched in full screen or you can enable Live Wallpaper mode and launch it in a small window to have new wallpaper generated for you regularly. \r\n\r\nThe default mode is a Live Wallpaper, so if you want a screensaver it will not launch on its own. You can change this app setting by clicking in the right bottom corner of the app window.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NJN8V930C5N","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Clipart Icons: Black and White Icon Bundle","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26479.13677385399646081.04714b86-59f5-47fe-b50e-6fffe92e3ce1.f2c32d1e-8257-473a-bcbe-4d331656eb1f","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25853.13677385399646081.828cc100-0250-40f1-b012-ff44cf8e0e89.192a9955-6630-4300-93ff-cf5b51309e19","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"StrikethroughPrice":"$7.99","DisplayPrice":"$0.99","Price":0.99,"AverageRating":4.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["15799Dinebulla.BW200Iconset_hb0h1tr5399ja"],"ContentIds":["bf54c1fa-2a8b-0df6-977d-6733f0a4601b","debd8577-8cc5-b78b-66f6-fe17642a9c3f"],"Badges":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V3.ProductBadge, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","StyleKey":"Default","Text":"SAVE $7.00","Type":"Merchandized"}],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"200 black and white clipart and icon selection, perfect for graphic design projects, presentations, postcards and much more.

Plan is a puzzle adventure game that takes place entirely inside an elevator. Go floor to floor, find items, and meet a bizarre cast of characters. Discover relationships between different things in the building and unlock its secrets. \r\n\r\nIt's the most fun you can have while stuck in an elevator.\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\nElevator-Scale VR\r\nFloor Plan: Hands-On Edition adds full support for motion controllers to the original game. Walk around the elevator, grab things, and press buttons! Or if you'd rather enjoy your buttons from a distance, you can play seated or standing with a variety of control options. \r\n\r\nClassic Genre, New Paint\r\nFloor Plan takes mechanics from your favorite classic point-and-click adventure games and reimagines them for first person VR. Whether you dream of inventory puzzles or you're a newcomer to the genre, you'll see it like you've never seen it before.\r\n\r\nPlay Your Way\r\nFigure out alternate solutions to puzzles, solve them in different orders, or call the operator if you need a nudge in the right direction.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT\r\nFloor Plan generally takes players about an hour to complete. We've priced it accordingly, and think it has enough special moments to be memorable and something you'll want to share with friends. Thanks for checking it out!\r\n\r\nYou can reach the developers on Twitter at @TurboButtonInc.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PFB6SL6QQW8","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"No Frills Checkbook","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9857.14208389874416797.14142102-d2ad-4080-a753-49f03db35309.1a73dd77-c767-4593-a3cd-575bba5ba8fe","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60721.14208389874416797.14142102-d2ad-4080-a753-49f03db35309.419e97db-e0fa-4157-bde4-549330023d69","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$1.99","Price":1.99,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["50197SamsopSoftware.NoFrillsCheckbook_me14tx6bx5sft"],"ContentIds":["bcfb2105-85af-f02b-bcc9-529517d2c402","44eb1516-ee1d-a286-bc05-362fa4b55577"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"A basic bank account management program.

We've also released a brand new PC version of Chaos Control optimised for better desktop experience. You can find more info and download the new app on our website: http://chaos-control.mobi\r\n*******\r\n\r\nPeople don't usually achieve impressive results simply by being good at task management. It's the ability to set legitimate goals that makes the difference. Just write down your desired outcomes to make them real. This simple technique helps you to prioritize your goals before acting on them.\r\n\r\nChaos Control is a task manager based on the best ideas of GTD (Getting Things Done) methodology created by David Allen. Whether you are running a business, launching an app, working on a project or simply planning your holiday trip, Chaos Control is a perfect tool to manage your goals, juggle your priorities, and organize your tasks to get things done. And the best part is, you can handle both heavyweight project planning and simple daily routine like shopping list management in one flexible app. Also, Chaos Control is available across all major mobile and desktop platforms with seamless sync.\r\n\r\nHERE IS HOW IT WORKS:\r\n\r\n1) MANAGE YOUR PROJECTS\r\nProject is a goal combined with a set of tasks you need to complete in order to achieve it. Create as many projects as you like to write down all the desired outcomes you have\r\n\r\n2) ORGANIZE YOUR GOALS\r\nCreate unlimited number of projects and group them by category using Folders\r\n\r\n3) USE GTD CONTEXTS\r\nOrganize tasks from different projects using flexible context lists. If you are familiar with GTD you would just love this feature\r\n\r\n4) PLAN YOUR DAY\r\nSet due dates for tasks and make plans for any particular day\r\n\r\n5) USE CHAOS BOX\r\nPut all the incoming tasks, notes and ideas into Chaos Box in order to process them later. It works similar to GTD inbox, but you can use it as a simple to-do list\r\n\r\n6) SYNC YOUR DATA\r\nChaos Control works on both desktop and mobile devices. Setup an account and sync your projects across all of your devices\r\n\r\nThis app is designed with creative people in mind. Designers, writers, developers, startup founders, entrepreneurs of all kinds and pretty much anyone with ideas and desire to make them happen. We combined the power of GTD with the convenient interface to help you with:\r\n■ personal goal setting\r\n■ task management\r\n■ time management\r\n■ planning your business and personal activities\r\n■ building your routine\r\n■ handling simple to do lists, checklists and shopping lists\r\n■ catching your ideas and thoughts to process them later\r\n\r\nKEY FEATURES\r\n■ Seamless cloud sync across all major mobile and desktop platforms\r\n■ GTD-inspired Projects and Contexts supplemented with Folders, sub-folders and sub-contexts\r\n■ Recurring tasks (daily, weekly, monthly and chosen days of the week)\r\n■ Chaos Box - Inbox for your unstructured tasks, notes, memos, ideas and thoughts. Great tool for staying on track inspired by GTD ideas\r\n■ Notes for tasks, projects, folders and contexts\r\n■ Fast and smart search\r\n\r\nHave a productive day!","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDRDDT","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Chronicle - Bill Reminders","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45045.9007199266559358.69223616-1f17-4fcd-9249-68e2ed0d683e.f1be8517-438c-4bc3-b8fd-6775989ee893","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#00a3a3","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15541.9007199266559358.080791bf-26a0-43a1-9cf9-4c6cc152b19f.6c97ea8a-a87b-4877-bf07-a78ecd149d0f","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#00a3a3","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$2.99","Price":2.99,"AverageRating":2.4,"RatingsCount":"39","PackageFamilyNames":["64115LittleFinLLC.Chronicle-BillReminders_h246d5fe0drna"],"ContentIds":["10233cc1-9514-6005-600f-d3155add45d4"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"If you pay bills, you'll love Chronicle!

If you're like me, you like creating quilts. Sometimes, you use a pattern and every step is finely detailed. A lot of the time, you create a quilt based on another quilt or pattern you've seen. You might make your quilt smaller or larger. You might make your quilt use some aspects of other quilts. If you're not using an exact pattern with exact measures, this application will be very useful. \r\nIn the past 3 years, I've created over 50 quilts. Along the way, I learned a few time saving techniques and relearned some geometry. I've also repeated a few calculations on every quilt, such as the number of fabric strips for each quilt's bindings. I've shrunk quilt dimensions to save fabric and/or to provide a quilt for a twin bed instead of a king.\r\nI've loaded this application with calculations I either regularly make or I never want to manually make again (Square Hypotenuse and Square & Triangle Calculators).  I'm researching more calculators that will be available in updates. If you have a need for another calculator, please let me know.\r\nThis first update includes a new calculator and the addition of 3 Pattern helper calculators.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDC2WK","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Text Editor 2915","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45288.9007199266355308.f4aedc08-8086-4621-bfd8-b4e3ba7948da.ca60667f-3c33-49cd-a763-90b169cf732e","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5532.9007199266355308.6caea11d-b25f-45dd-a226-57d40fc17740.71d4114e-2dde-4cc5-ba37-28c6ac1b9cd0","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$1.49","Price":1.49,"AverageRating":2.8,"RatingsCount":"5","PackageFamilyNames":["PureIO.TextEngine_kg1wrcv69s6t8"],"ContentIds":["5ad73d59-88bf-e6aa-d08c-87aaca5ca269"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"A text editor with options for text color, font, background color or background video ( .mp4 .avi .wmv )","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDC2XQ","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"MyMeta","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.40004.9007199266355273.4eb63243-745c-499b-83ea-4c5882f72b6a.bfae1314-14bc-4441-9ead-7068053507b1","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#033C57","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.13676.9007199266355273.02627965-7af0-469a-9fd5-a991973ec376.99c5e76d-6279-449b-b54c-36b6ba0d08c2","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#033C57","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$3.49","Price":3.49,"AverageRating":3.5,"RatingsCount":"58","PackageFamilyNames":["bizmodeller.58466F24F43EE_ramncqzs7hgb4"],"ContentIds":["3d2ba798-a54a-8b4e-ef3c-802da15714bf"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"MyMeta is a powerful metadata editor for MP4, M4V and MOV video files for Windows 10, 8.1 and 8.

Join our big submarine patrol team. Be on our submarine! \r\n\r\nLegend says: The year was 1982. Argentina invaded the Falklands and other British territories in the South Atlantic. The British sent an expeditionary force to retake the islands. \r\n\r\nIn Submarine Patrol, you will relive this era as a leader of a submarine that patrols the islands and destroys enemy battleships.   \r\n\r\nTarget well before you shoot! Remember, you have a limited number of torpedoes on board. You cannot immediately fire one torpedo after another. \r\n\r\nIt takes 2-3 seconds to prepare the next torpedo. Injured ships, depending on the amount of damage, may reduce their speed and move slower. \r\n\r\nDepending on the ship type, you can hit it 1 to 4 times before it is completely destroyed. You have 10 levels to complete. If you do well you will be promoted to commander, captain, or even an admiral. The quality of shooting is determined by your score. You score with every successful shot and you are fined with every missed torpedo.  \r\n\r\nPlease, check our website for tips and tricks on the game here: http://pepper-games.com","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDFZQV","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Kids Learn to Read (Preschool)","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48584.9007199266294589.069a6d75-161e-4a80-a739-3fd0d6456417.91ebdc6b-1ca8-4501-95dd-782bcac68000","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#2b5666","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14788.9007199266294589.2d721035-59b2-43b6-bca7-02a9c46d6463.9c3b5ba3-c761-403a-ac97-94d612ab597f","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#2b5666","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26880.9007199266294589.610920b5-ed90-4719-8b1f-82e13a50158c.28e2137f-7e39-4d56-8657-916ef0913e12","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#2b5666","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33380.9007199266294589.72f926ad-2fbf-446d-977f-8ad4576275c4.b50c42ac-f964-4f4d-972e-03f5b6d216f3","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#2b5666","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$2.99","Price":2.99,"AverageRating":3.7,"RatingsCount":"107","PackageFamilyNames":["Intellijoy.KidsLearntoReadPreschool_aeskzhp7pykjg"],"ContentIds":["924434b6-eb68-f854-4485-a3e526eebbd0","80b78112-4632-042c-5ce2-d6c83b76bf70","67488c98-f2da-e508-d366-8df18e8a0644","11c9abba-7f9b-5b48-8495-12c1868248a6"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Kids Learn to Read is the latest child-pleasing addition to Intellijoy's best-selling reading curriculum series, and is preceded by Kids ABC Letters and Kids ABC Phonics.\r\n\r\nKids Learn to Read is a delightful game that invites preschool-aged children to practice blending sounds together to read and spell simple words, such as \"dog\", \"sun\", and \"big\".\r\nIts six sections include:\r\n\r\n- In Magic Letter Bridge kids learn to blend letter sounds into words by moving Tommy the Turtle across the letter bridge as each letter is sounded out and a word is formed and pronounced. Your kids can hand Tommy a skateboard to make him go faster as they become comfortable with blending the sounds.\r\n\r\n- With Skateboards and Helmets children practice reading as they are asked to fit Tommy's animal friends with skateboards and helmets.\r\n\r\n- In Turn the Blocks kids make words in a way that's fun by turning real-looking blocks with letters on each side until the word is spelled out.\r\n\r\n- Through Word Ball children learn to identify spoken words by helping Tommy bat the right ball.\r\n\r\n- With Word Magic kids learn about word families as they fill the corresponding pot with potion and watch magic happen\r\n\r\n- In Rocket Words children get to practice word families as they assemble and launch a rocket into space\r\n\r\nIf your children do not know the alphabet sounds yet, we recommend our Kids ABC Phonics app. And if your kids need to learn or practice the names of the letters, try our Kids ABC Letters app.\r\n\r\nEvery section is designed to let children enjoy success time after time and receive positive reinforcement from the likable teacher, so they want to keep learning. Once your child is involved and happy, you can relax, with the assurance that he or she is having a great time - and learning.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDG14W","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"The Island: Castaway® 2 (Full)","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.19895.9007199266305568.11d024da-051a-4223-af75-7f4654b9f569.f921e54a-c30a-460e-9aa3-953be888ce91","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.5180.9007199266305568.2d4583ed-8e3d-4845-a201-3d24025b5209.ad27fa68-b861-40ac-9425-78c555aa0ded","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.24728.9007199266305568.57d35da5-a7b0-404f-816b-a6c931520bd0.b8901c78-2cd1-48ca-aaf4-92dac0a89069","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.64605.9007199266305568.0fd48417-69d7-4e0d-a2fa-e37289c064e5.cff86cd6-6061-4596-bd4d-f8f41d4397fd","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.45664.9007199266305568.776fcc5d-8335-4b59-a73b-0337fc7fd244.edf5e6f1-332d-4cb0-8e4c-abb1497484c9","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.56518.9007199266305568.2a4d5122-df91-47ea-9b22-c09342567d7c.fb3b0479-e810-4411-b622-c69ea36decc5","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$6.99","Price":6.99,"AverageRating":4.4,"RatingsCount":"220","PackageFamilyNames":["828B5831.TheIslandCastaway2Full_ytsefhwckbdv6"],"ContentIds":["82783adc-8db9-c478-8b19-6c39ba35a793"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"The much-anticipated sequel to the vibrant simulation game The Island: Castaway is here!

Regardless of the number of correct answers given, and of stars earned, the child’s developing skills will be fostered by enthusiastic applause and floating balloons!\r\n\r\nThe educational flashcards for kids are divided into the following categories: “Cars and Transport”, “Professions”, “Buildings”, “Musical Instruments”, “Tools”, “Furniture”, “Kitchen Tools” and “Clothing and shoes”. \r\n\r\nOne important distinction makes this educational app stand out from the rest: instead of drawings, which are not always easy to identify as a real object, the child will see bright, beautiful and fun-spirited photographs. This will allow the child to “see” each object as it actually appears in the real world, while allowing the parent to tell the child more about this object.\r\n\r\nDoes the youngster have an older brother or sister in grade school? They can also use this educational game! In addition to English, this app also supports the Spanish, German and many other languages. \r\n\r\nWhile playing with the educational flashcards in a foreign language, a school-age child can effortlessly learn many new words with which to surprise their teachers and classmates. An A+ is guaranteed!\r\n\r\nThe youngster does not need to be able to read in order to use this educational app. The simple interface and spoken clues allow even the youngest of children to play and learn independently. \r\n\r\nExperience has shown that children love to look through a series of colorful pictures with sounds, and they will ask to see them again and again. According to Glenn Doman, an American physical therapist and the founder of The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential, participating in these kinds of educational activities (for 5-10 minutes a day) stimulates the development of various regions in the brain. As a result, the child's photographic memory takes shape, the child develops much faster than his or her peers, and, beginning at infancy, the child gains access to a world of encyclopedic knowledge. \r\n\r\nThe main point, in which Doman is undoubtedly correct, is that the younger a child, the more easily he or she can absorb new knowledge. It's important to make use of this ability while it's available!\r\n\r\nThe app can be used as a supplementary teaching aid in foreign language instruction. Supported languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Russian, Polish, Ukrainian.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDSHWP","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Kids learn about Animals, Birds and Pets, full app","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10841.9007199266578620.3bf089e3-63e1-4182-a220-fad7ae13d0d2.b064972a-6e3a-4f21-9817-db74633a3d8e","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#68C827","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23947.9007199266578620.b2cbd444-0c3a-4c90-b39c-03aaa2914547.4a44ef2c-48d8-4eb8-b165-9a362eda4378","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#68C827","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33597.9007199266578620.dc704aa3-4125-4c92-a686-6d766af24150.fcea8d58-289a-49fb-801c-28ca9f7f4b40","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#68C827","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56639.9007199266578620.f3bb2070-23d8-4339-b0d6-69357e564d52.4dcbca87-a2fa-4712-b057-db56488fba29","Height":558,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#68C827","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7782.9007199266578620.21014eb0-84a0-475e-95dc-31c45e2950d6.e95f17fb-4531-4dfe-8673-8303411425cf","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#68C827","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36496.9007199266578620.1a8847fd-241c-46de-bcb5-39321b5c8f08.5a41e6f5-e1d6-4dfe-9078-04304af29b9c","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#68C827","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46414.9007199266578620.dfb70141-c7d6-46e1-9913-b170cf46e861.4d62d192-4faa-4e8d-ace9-f67e424de6be","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#68C827","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$1.99","Price":1.99,"AverageRating":4.6,"RatingsCount":"5","PackageFamilyNames":["32004CLEVERBIT.538611ED17625_krxe918j0j7ce"],"ContentIds":["8587c953-0424-3d40-bd84-0be07e0f3b17","01390b90-3505-02e9-7d10-2adf4a36c116"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"\"Kids learn about Animals\" is an educational game for children aged 1 - 4 years from the series “Little One Learns Words”!\r\n\r\nTogether with your child, you can watch wonderful images of different animals, all while learning their names and listen to the animals’ unique sounds!\r\n\r\nThese carefully selected photographs allow your child to not only learn the names of the various animals, but also glimpse into the animal’s beautiful world and everything it offers! \r\n\r\nAfter your child looks over and experiences the flashcards, there is a fun game waiting for them, which tests how much they’ve understood.
